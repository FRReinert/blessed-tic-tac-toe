This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in TypeScript that runs in the terminal. Challenge your friends to a classic game of Tic Tac Toe right in your command line!

```

Once you have the game cloned, you can run enter the folder and run the game:
```sh
cd blessed-tic-tac-toe
npm run start
```

## How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.

To make a move, simply use the arrow keys or vim motions \<h, j , k, l> and press `Space` to place your symbol.
